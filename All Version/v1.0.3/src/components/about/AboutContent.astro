              <p>My Story</p>
              <p>
                Well, let me tell you a little bit about myself, I was a
                13-year-old boy and I was very interested in internet phones.
                After some time, this interest increased and I decided to buy a
                computer to get to know this environment a little more. I said
                it would be better to get a little training and I started to see
                training about anything from the computer, but everything has a
                price and the price of this work was the time and the money I
                spent to buy my system was lost. Now you say, why am I telling
                you now because the system It gave me an error that I didn't
                know how to solve, and out of curiosity I tampered with the
                system and changed the devices. After about 2 days, I found out
                that the system was broken, but it was added to my knowledge
                that my brother, you don't know anything, don't touch it. But in
                short, anyone who comes to the computer field should be curious
                to know how it works, otherwise that person is not good for this
                field, many people made fun of me, but now they are proud of me
                because I am their colleague, I owe all this to God, stop it!

              <h2>I am a web designer, what does that mean?</h2>
              <p>
                A web designer is a person who is both technically and coding
                skilled and very creative. Both of these features will be
                reflected in the work of the site designer to the same extent.
                While the site design should have the ability and skill to
                implement a functional and professional website, it should also
                keep in mind the importance of using the site in terms of ux or
                user experience (which is at the end of the article about that
                we are talking about) should be simple and easy for everyone and
                make the website attractive and user-friendly by using aesthetic
                techniques.

              <h3>And proficient in html css, what does that mean?</h3>
              <p>
                HTML is derived from the first letters of the term
                HyperTextMarkupLanguage and is a text markup language (the
                standard language of web pages). Usually, on a page on the web,
                there is a set of texts, photos, different sections, with the
                help of tags and codes provided by HTML, you can create a
                specific structure of information in this section. Create and
                display to visitors. Note that each tag in HTML language has its
                own meaning and concept. pages that are made by this language;
                They consist of markup tags and have the extension htm or html.
                These pages can be edited in various editor programs such as
                Notepad, Visual Stadio, dearm weaver and... Edited and changed.
                In the html language, different sections and codes (server side
                and client side) are separated by "tags" and these tags are a
                tool for how to display information on web pages and by
                browsers. In fact, tags determine different forms of displaying
                different elements of a web page. Css is shortened or stands for
                Cascading Style Sheets, which is a page layout feature; It
                provides styling and beautification of web pages for site
                designers. In fact, the structure of a page is determined using
                HTML, and then this structure and layout is styled by using
                other codes. All colors, dimensions and sizes, borders,
                placement, fonts. and other characteristics of the components of
                a web page will be determined using css. These characteristics
                will be displayed to users by browsers; Because CSS is a
                specific standard defined for Internet browser programs, and for
                this reason, a web page can be seen in the same way in different
                browsers. Usually, in modern website design methods, all
                css-related codes are placed in a separate file, and inline
                styling (inside each HTML tag) is no longer used; Because this
                work is not suitable for web pages in terms of SEO. So, in a
                general definition, by using css, you can create the desired
                form and style for a web page in such a way that it is
                beautiful, attractive, practical and user-friendly.

              <h4>Who is a digital marketer?</h4>
              <p>
                Nowadays, everyone is more or less familiar with internet
                businesses; Today's internet businesses, just like the old
                business companies, need someone to handle the marketing of the
                company. The term digital marketing is composed of two words
                "digital" and "marketing", which if we translate this term
                literally, we get to "digital marketing". Of course, keep in
                mind that "digital marketing" is very different from
                "traditional marketing", but both people have the same goal and
                try to increase the sales of a company or organization. Digital
                marketing also has a simple definition that can help you get to
                know this profession a lot. "Digital marketing means the use of
                digital tools in order to communicate with the audience, market
                and sell products and finally convince them to take the desired
                action." Today, internet businesses are trying to attract more
                customers and increase their sales. That's why all of them,
                which you consider to be a successful online business, have a
                professional digital marketing expert on their team. Of course,
                a digital marketing expert plays the role of a company's
                marketing leader; Coordination and communication between SEO,
                content marketer and social media marketing is the
                responsibility of digital marketer. Of course, keep in mind that
                these roles may increase or decrease depending on the size of a
                company. For example, in some large companies, instead of a
                content expert, there is a content team, each of which has
                smaller roles.
